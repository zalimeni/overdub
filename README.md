# overdub
Create new commands from your shell history or terminal.

## TODO list for initial release
- Filter out unlikely commands (e.g. package managers) from suggestions list
- Actually support making an alias (basic)
- Parsing of commands to aid creation of parameterized aliases (shell fns? command lib?)
- If managing shell profiles for alias creation:
  - Bootstrap files, support `install` subcommand
  - Support installation of auto-completion program or add to README
- If not doing ^: support auto-complete some other way
